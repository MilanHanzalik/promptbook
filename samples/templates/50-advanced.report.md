-   COST UNKNOWN

### Prompt

```
Write a short comparison of the meaning of the two sentences, writing a maximum of 5 sentences:

## Sentence 1:

> The cat displayed all the classic feline characteristics, from its sleek fur to its graceful movements.

## Sentence 2:

> The displayed all the classic feline characteristics, from its sleek fur to its graceful movements.
```

### Result

```
Sentence 1 specifies "the cat" as the subject, attributing the classic feline characteristics directly to it. In contrast, Sentence 2 is incomplete, missing the noun "cat," which makes it unclear what is displaying those characteristics. As a result, Sentence 1 is clear and complete, while Sentence 2 is vague and grammatically incorrect. Thus, only Sentence 1 effectively conveys the intended meaning of a cat exemplifying typical feline traits.
